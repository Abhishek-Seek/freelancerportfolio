        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-7 text-lg">
          Digital marketing is one of the most powerful tools available to businesses today. Whether
          you are a local service provider or a global ecommerce brand, digital marketing helps you
          reach, engage, and convert your ideal customers — all in real time.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-7 text-lg mt-6">
          Through targeted strategies like <strong>SEO (Search Engine Optimization)</strong>, your website can
          appear on the first page of Google when potential customers search for services you offer.
          <strong> Google Ads</strong> and <strong>PPC campaigns</strong> drive instant traffic and leads, ensuring you are visible
          exactly when users are ready to take action.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-7 text-lg mt-6">
          With <strong>social media marketing</strong>, you can build a strong brand presence on platforms like
          Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. This allows you to connect with your audience, create
          engaging content, and run effective ad campaigns that boost awareness and drive
          conversions.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-7 text-lg mt-6">
          <strong>Content marketing</strong> helps position your brand as an expert in your field, attracting organic
          traffic and nurturing trust over time. Combined with <strong>email marketing</strong> and automation, you
          can keep leads engaged and convert them into long-term customers.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-7 text-lg mt-6">
          The beauty of digital marketing lies in its <strong>measurability and flexibility</strong>. You can track every
          click, view, and conversion — and optimize campaigns for better ROI.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-7 text-lg mt-6 font-semibold">
          In short, digital marketing is not just promotion — it is a growth engine that puts your
          business in front of the right people, at the right time, with the right message.
